Our App 'SHG_1' was made with the objective to empower the Self-Help Group Community to manage their monetary assets.
The app helps in making and managing self-help groups. A SHG will have a manager who will ue this app to keep formal 
records of members and those of lenders (can be people/institutions like banks). The functionalities provided are add and view
functions for:
1. Managing Members
2. Manage Transactions 
	- Individual Transactions(Money Exchange within group)
	- Group Transactions(SHG takes outside money).

Currently this is a demo application for our idea. What we want this app to achieve is to help in effective 
management to money within the grop and also to directly connect the SHG to intitutions like banks etc. so that the 
group has a platform to launch itself and works towards their betterment and self-sustenance.
